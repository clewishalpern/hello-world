# hello-world
It's a great day to dare greatly. It's time I learned to code. Thanks in advance to everyone for their enthusiasm, support and help. Hope I can be a contributor as well.

My name is Christina, aka CLH. I've done some simple html and css. I love chicken and design thinking. I don't like tacos or long lecutures.
